# DSA Library

DSA Library is a beginner-friendly repository that contains all the major Data Structures & Algorithms implemented in 5 different languages. Through this repository we aim to create a centralized DSA resource which we may look up to for revision before tech interviews.
This repository is maintained by: [Simran Yadav](https://github.com/ishiprayadav), [Amartya Yadav](https://github.com/iamartyaa), .

Note: <i>This repository is created with the sole intent of guiding beginners to their initial Open Source contributions.</i>

## What to contribute?

Dsa-library is a culmination of all major Data Structures and Algorithms.You can contribute to the data stucture of your choice, it's implementation in either of C,C++,JAVA,PYHTON,JAVASCRIPT.

Apart from that, you can check the Algorithms section and add an algorithm of your choice implemented in any of the above mentioned 5 languages. 


## How to Contribute?
- `Fork` the repository
- To add implementation of a Data Structure/ Algorithm navigate to the respective folder
- If the Data Structure or Algorithm you want to add doesn't have a folder, you are free to create a new folder
- Inside the respective folder, click `Create new file`
- File name convention: DataStructure_languageName.extension or AlgorithmName_languageName.extension
- Add the complete implementation & `commit` the changes
- `Sync` to Fetch Upstream & if there are no merge conflicts ,click on `Contribute`
- Create `Pull Request` following proper convention
- That's it, Thank You for contributing to DSA Library

We appreciate all kinds of contributions from core-code contributions to non-code contributions like writing a blog, suggesting a feature, etc.
